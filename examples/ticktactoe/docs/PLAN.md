# Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Create a fully functional, interactive tic-tac-toe game with a clean user interface that supports both human vs human and human vs AI gameplay modes.

**Scope**: 
- Web-based tic-tac-toe game with responsive design
- Two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI
- Game state management including win/draw detection
- Simple AI opponent with configurable difficulty
- Score tracking across multiple games
- Clean, modern UI with animations and visual feedback

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Functional web application accessible via browser
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- AI opponent with at least basic strategy
- Complete game logic with proper win/draw detection
- User documentation and setup instructions
- Test suite covering core game functionality
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory

**Primary Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript/JavaScript, Web APIs
**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: **[To be implemented]** - OpenRouter token usage cost (estimated $2-5 for small projects like this based on Gemini 2.5 Flash pricing)
