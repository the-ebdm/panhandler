# Panhandler - AI Agent Orchestration System

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Build a scalable AI agent orchestration system that autonomously plans, estimates, and executes software development projects with transparent cost tracking based on OpenRouter token usage.

**Scope**: 
- Pubsub-based agent coordination system using Deepstream.io
- Complete agent ecosystem (Planner, Estimator, Developer, Quality, Supervisor, Documentation, etc.)
- Documentation-centric project knowledge management
- Tiered supervision model scaling with user budget
- Smart scope creep detection and handling
- User-configurable decision weights for transparent adjudication
- Web interface for project management and monitoring
- OpenRouter token cost estimation and tracking

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Functional Panhandler system capable of autonomous project execution
- Complete agent ecosystem with pubsub coordination
- Documentation-centric project structure generation
- Web interface for project management
- Cost estimation system based on token usage patterns
- Comprehensive system documentation and operational guides
- Deployment pipeline for production use

**Primary Technologies**: BunJS/TypeScript, LangGraph/LangChain, OpenRouter API, Deepstream.io, PostgreSQL
**Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks
**Estimated Cost**: **[To be properly implemented]** - OpenRouter token usage cost (estimated $50-150 for system development based on complexity)

## Key Risks
- **Agent Coordination Complexity**: Managing state and communication between multiple AI agents
- **Cost Model Accuracy**: Building reliable token usage prediction without historical data
- **Pubsub System Reliability**: Ensuring robust message delivery and handling failures
- **AI Model Dependencies**: Reliance on external APIs (OpenRouter) for core functionality
- **Scope Creep in Meta-Development**: The system building itself could suffer from the problems it aims to solve
- **Performance at Scale**: System behavior with multiple concurrent projects and agents

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Complete project execution from repository input to working deliverable
- ✅ Accurate cost prediction within 20% variance
- ✅ Documentation-centric knowledge preservation for all projects
- ✅ Tiered supervision working across all budget levels
- ✅ Scope creep detection and handling preventing project derailment
- ✅ User satisfaction with transparency and control
- ✅ System can dogfood itself (build projects using Panhandler)
- ✅ Production deployment handling concurrent users and projects

## Architecture Principles
- **Event-Driven**: All agent communication via pubsub events
- **Stateless Agents**: Agents maintain no internal state, all state in database
- **Fault Tolerant**: Agent failures don't cascade or break the system
- **Cost Transparent**: Every operation tracks and reports token usage
- **User Controlled**: Users maintain control over priorities and decision-making
- **Documentation First**: Every action generates and maintains documentation
- **Scalable**: System handles increasing load through horizontal scaling

## Business Model Validation
- **Value Proposition**: $2-5 vs $400-600 for equivalent traditional development
- **Repeat Customers**: Documentation quality and system reliability drive retention  
- **Tiered Revenue**: Higher-paying customers get better service levels
- **Network Effects**: Better cost models improve service for all users
- **Expansion Opportunities**: Custom agents, enterprise features, white-labeling

## Next Steps
This plan serves as the master blueprint for Panhandler development. Each phase will generate detailed implementation plans in `docs/plans/` as the Plan Expander agents (initially human-driven) break down macro steps into executable micro steps.
