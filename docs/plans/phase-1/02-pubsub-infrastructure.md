## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Deepstream.io server starts and accepts connections
- [ ] Agents can successfully publish and subscribe to events
- [ ] Event routing delivers messages to correct recipients
- [ ] Failed events are properly handled and retried
- [ ] Event persistence and replay functionality works
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows real-time event flow
- [ ] Performance meets throughput and latency requirements
- [ ] All event communication patterns function correctly

## Risk Mitigation

- **Deepstream.io Scaling**: Plan migration to Apache Kafka if scale requirements exceed capabilities
- **Message Ordering**: Implement sequence numbers and ordering guarantees where needed
- **Network Partitions**: Design for eventual consistency and partition tolerance
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Use versioned schemas to handle breaking changes gracefully

## Cost Estimation

**[To be properly implemented]** - Token usage cost estimation based on OpenRouter API pricing

**Target Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20 (thinking)

- Input: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: $3.50 per 1M tokens
- Context Limit: 1M tokens

**Estimated Token Usage** (preliminary):

- Configuration and setup code: ~18,000 output tokens
- Event schema and interface generation: ~15,000 output tokens
- Testing and validation code: ~12,000 output tokens
- Documentation and examples: ~8,000 output tokens
- Architecture analysis and optimization: ~10,000 input tokens
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0.19-0.27 (subject to actual usage patterns)

_Note: This is a foundational component that will be extensively used by all other agents, justifying higher initial investment._

## Next Steps

Upon completion, this pubsub infrastructure enables:

- **Phase 1, Macro Step 3**: Database Schema development with event-driven updates
- **Phase 1, Macro Step 4**: Basic Agent Framework with communication capabilities
- **All future agents**: Reliable inter-agent communication and coordination
