## Validation Criteria
- [ ] All workspace packages build successfully with `bun run build`
- [ ] Development servers start with `bun run dev`
- [ ] Linting passes across all packages with `bun run lint`
- [ ] Tests execute successfully with `bun run test`
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
- [ ] Git hooks prevent commits with quality issues
- [ ] Docker images build successfully for all package types
- [ ] Container registry accepts and stores images with proper tagging
- [ ] `make deploy` successfully deploys to development cluster
- [ ] Helm charts validate and deploy successfully to development environment
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully on pull requests
- [ ] Documentation generates and deploys correctly

## Risk Mitigation

- **Monorepo Complexity**: Start with simpler structure and refactor if needed
- **Workspace Dependencies**: Use exact version pinning to avoid conflicts
- **Build Performance**: Implement incremental builds and caching strategies
- **Container Complexity**: Start with simple Dockerfiles and optimize iteratively
- **Deployment Dependencies**: Ensure container registry and cluster access before deployment automation

## Cost Estimation
**[To be properly implemented]** - Token usage cost estimation based on OpenRouter API pricing

**Target Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20 (thinking)
- Input: $0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: $3.50 per 1M tokens
- Context Limit: 1M tokens

**Estimated Token Usage** (preliminary):
- Configuration file generation: ~12,000 output tokens
- Documentation generation: ~8,000 output tokens
- Script and automation setup: ~10,000 output tokens
- Docker and container configuration: ~8,000 output tokens
- Helm chart and Kubernetes configuration: ~6,000 output tokens
- Makefile and deployment automation: ~5,000 output tokens
- Code review and optimization: ~8,000 input tokens
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0.18-0.24 (subject to actual usage patterns)

*Note: Cost estimation will be refined as we build pattern recognition from completed setup tasks.*

## Next Steps
Upon completion, this infrastructure enables:
- **Phase 1, Macro Step 2**: Pubsub Infrastructure development
- **All subsequent development**: Scalable monorepo with quality gates
- **Team collaboration**: Consistent development environment and practices
